## Machine learning project for Adult Census Income Prediction

For this assignment, I examine the Census Income dataset available at the keggle website.
my aim is to predict whether an individualâ€™s income will be greater than $50,000 per year based on several 
attributes from the census data.

The Census Income dataset has many entries. Each entry contains the following information
about an individual: 
age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education_num, marital-status, occupation, relationship,
race, gender, capital-gain,	capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country, income-per-anum

I apply Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression algorithm.

Best Model For this data is: Random Forest.

I got accuracy Score : 0.835461972155103
